# Stability_diagrams

Dispersion relation solver for Landau Damping.
Solving transverse and longitudinal dispersion relations written by [Scott Berg](https://doi.org/10.1109/PAC.1997.750810).
This solver is extended to deal with vlasov formalism for higher order chromaticity, RFQ and Pulsed electron lens. This was initially outlined by [M.Schenk and A.Maillard](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.21.084402)
